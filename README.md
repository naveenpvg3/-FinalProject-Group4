# Datamining Project
##High Value Customer Identification
The aim of this project is to apply data mining techniques in python language to a real world problem.
Project objective with the dataset obtained is to find ‘significant customers’ for the business who make high purchases of their favorite products. Dataset used is obtained from a UK-based online retail store on high value customer identification (based on customers with high purchases,regular customers and irregular customers .) The organization wants to roll out a loyalty program to high-value customers after the identification of segments. 
This dataset contains transactions occurring between November-2016 to December-2017 for the UK based online retail store. (Source:Kaggle)
Applied a data mining algorithm, K-means clustering to cluster the data and gain valuable insights.
For the K-means clustering method, the most common approach for metric evaluation is the so-called elbow method.  It involves running the algorithm multiple times over a loop, with an increasing number of cluster choices, and then plotting a clustering score as a function of the number of clusters.
